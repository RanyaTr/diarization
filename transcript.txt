SPEAKER 1 0:00:00
I'd like to be honest, thank you for seeing us today. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:04
Of course Laura, it's great to meet you both. How are you feeling about everything today? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:08
Well we are excited but also nervous. It feels like there is so much to think about. Yeah we've been reading up on things but it's a lot to take in. We're just trying to make sense of it all. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:20
Well look that's really understandable. There are many best parenthood and it sometimes might seem overwhelming or complicated and we will work together to find the best one for you guys. 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:34
Laura, since you are planning to carry the baby, could you tell me a bit more about your 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:38
menstrual cycle? 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:39
Is it regular? Yeah please, could you elaborate on that? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:44
Yes, it's mostly regular. My cycles are around 28 days but I've been noticing more painful periods lately so I'm not sure if that's something to worry about or not. 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:57
Oh brilliant. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:58
This is really good to mention. Painful periods can sometimes be linked to conditions like endometriosis when the tissue of your uterus travels into your pelvis, other areas and it might actually impact fertility. 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:13
Have you ever been evaluated or seen by a doctor about this painful periods before? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:18
No, I never had any tests. I just thought it was normal. We've been wondering if it could be a problem but we weren't sure if it was worth bringing 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:26
up. 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:28
Well, it's always really worth mentioning so thank you for bringing it up. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:34
We'll start by scheduling some basic tests including an ultramar sound to check for any potential issues. This will help us to make sure there is nothing that could complicate things. 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:47
Does that sound okay to you guys? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:48
Yeah, sounds good. Definitely. We want to be sure we're not missing anything. 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:53
Great. Now let's talk about your family history. Have you, have there been any fertility related issues in your family like early men 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:02
oppose or conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome that you are aware of? 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:08
Actually, yes. My mom went through menopause early so around 42 I think. So I've been a bit worried about that too. 
SPEAKER 3 0:02:17
Yeah, that's good. Early menopause and family members can sometimes indicate lower ovarian reserve which means 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:24
there might be fewer eggs available in the ovary and fertility could actually decrease earlier. 
SPEAKER 3 0:02:32
It doesn't mean that will definitely happen to you but we will do some tests to check 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:36
your ovarian reserve including a hormone called AMH and also along with the ultrasound and the antrophotocal sound we will get some help as well. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:48
So does that mean we need to hurry with the treatment? 
SPEAKER 3 0:02:52
Not necessarily but it's better to have this information now so we can make informed 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:57
decisions. 
SPEAKER 3 0:02:58
If the test show lower ovarian reserve we might recommend moving a bit faster or even 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:03
consider egg freezing if you are open to it but we will wait for the results before jumping into conclusions. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:10
Okay, that makes sense. I hadn't thought about egg freezing but it's good to know that it's an option. Great. 
SPEAKER 3 0:03:19
So what's the option? Based on what you've shared I'd recommend starting with an intrauterion insemination or 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:26
what's called IOUI. 
SPEAKER 3 0:03:28
It's less invasive, let's invasive treatment story and it's often successful for same 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:33
sex couples using donor sperm. 
SPEAKER 3 0:03:37
Does that sound like something you are open to? 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:39
Yes, we were open to start with something less intense than IVF so IOUI sounds like a good first step. I agree. We've already talked to a friend who is willing to be our donor. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:52
Would that work for us? 
SPEAKER 3 0:03:54
That's wonderful. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:55
Having an on donor can make the process more personal. We'll need to arrange some health secreting for the donor to ensure everything is in order. How do you both feel about using a fresh sperm sample versus frozen one? 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:10
Well, what would you recommend? 
SPEAKER 3 0:04:12
Well if your donor is local and willing to provide a sample in the clinic, a fresh 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:18
sample might slightly improve your chances in having a normal pregnancy and a baby but frozen sample, it just offers more flexibility when it comes to the timing of the IOUI. So what's your preference? 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:34
I think fresh would be best. It feels like more natural and the donor is willing to be there for us. Yeah, we're all really close so it would be nice if he could be involved directly. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:46
Amazing. 
SPEAKER 3 0:04:47
That sounds like a soul of the blind. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:48
Now Laura, are you taking any supplements like folic acid or making any lifestyle changes in the preparation for the process? 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:57
Yes, I've been taking folic acid for a few months now and I've kept down caffeine and also I'm trying to eat a few. Yeah, she's been really good about it. We've both been trying to improve our diets together. 
SPEAKER 3 0:05:11
Oh, that's excellent. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:13
A balanced diet and staying active can be very helpful indeed. 
SPEAKER 3 0:05:18
Mary, I'm glad to hear that you are both supporting each other through this. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:23
Do you have any other concerns or questions about the process? 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:26
Just one. Yeah. How soon can we get started? We're ready to move forward as soon as possible. 
SPEAKER 3 0:05:33
Well, your infuse hasn't is really great. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:36
Once we get the initial test results back and your donor is secreined, we can plan the timing for the insemination or the IOI. Typically, it doesn't take long to set up. We'll get the ball rolling right away. That's great news. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:52
We were worried it would be a long way. Yes, thank you so much Dr. Burnett. 
SPEAKER 3 0:05:56
This feels like I feel a lot more confident about everything. Thank you. You're a very welcome guys and good luck. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:02
Thank you.
