Thanks very much for the introduction.

The Chair, ladies and gentlemen, a very

good morning. To

start off, I want to thank the Human

Reduction Editorial Team and the ASHRAE

organizing committee for inviting me. It

is truly an honor to be here and talk

about a topic that is so important to

many expectant parents.

This is my cufflower interest and some

extra disclosures.
