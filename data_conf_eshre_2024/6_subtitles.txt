pregnancy, miscarriage, pregnancy

complications, stillbirth, preterm

birth, neonatal disease, or even death.

Miscarriage is defined as the loose of

the fetus before it is viable.

This sounds pretty straightforward,

but the gestational age threshold for

defining what makes a miscarriage

very significant.
